# odin-library-project
Technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, JS.

This project helped me to learn more advanced concepts such as how to call a class object into a function to return the desired results of that new object.
for example this project was creating a library where I created a book using a constructor. This constructor was called inside my function in order to populate the required fields to generate a book object for my library. It was fun and I used a lot of MDN whenever I got stuck.
